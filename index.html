			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/profile.png" alt="My photo" title="Here's a picture of me in Rome!">
 
			<p>Hi! My name is Chryssa Jones and I'm an aspiring web developer, enrolled in the Full Stack Developer Boot Camp at UC San Diego.  I'm currently working as a higher education administrator in Student Affairs at UC San Diego, and I have 8 years of experience in this industry. Previously, I've worked as an operations manager, a project manager, a marketing and social media director, a copy writer and editor, a bookkeeper, and a small-business owner.<p>
			
			<p>I love coding because it gives me an opportunity to be creative and precise, and seeing my creations unfold exactly as I want them to is really exciting! Finding and squashing bugs is a fun part of the process, like a scavenger hunt.  I love the flexibility it gives me, I love being part of a team, and I'm looking forward to a new career opportunity.</p>
