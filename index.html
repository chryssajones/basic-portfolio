		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/profile.png" alt="My photo" title="Here's a picture of me in Rome!">

		<p>Hi, my name is Chryssa Jones, and I'm an aspiring web developer.  I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Developer Boot Camp at UC San Diego, where I also work full-time as a student affairs administrator.  I've been in this line of work for about 7 years now.  It's a good job, but it's not what I want to spend the rest of my career doing.  So, I'm pursuing a career change and this boot camp is the first step!</p>

		<p>I love coding because it gives me an opportunity to be creative and precise, and seeing my creations unfold exactly as I want them to is really exciting! Finding and squashing bugs is a fun part of the process, like a scavenger hunt.  I love the flexibility it gives me, I love being part of a team, and I'm looking forward to a new career opportunity.</p>
